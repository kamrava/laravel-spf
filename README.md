# Laravel SPF
Integrating SPF.js with Laravel

For Laravel 5.x

Laravel SPF package allows to bring awesome SPF.js to your Laravel app. Here is a description from SPF.js official doc :

> Structured Page Fragments — or SPF for short — is a lightweight JS framework for fast navigation and page updates from YouTube.

> Using progressive enhancement and HTML5, SPF integrates with your site to enable a faster, more fluid user experience by updating just the sections of the page that change during navigation, not the whole page. SPF provides a response format for sending document fragments, a robust system for script and style management, an in-memory cache, on-the-fly processing, and more.
